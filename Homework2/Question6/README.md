## Question 5:
Change Scanner's delimiter, and tokenize comma separated values entered by 
the keyboard.

Question 6:
Your job is to tokenize individual characters. Your code looks like:
```java
Scanner in = ...
in.useDelimiter()

while(in.hasNext()){
	print the current token.
}
```

What delimiter should you use here?

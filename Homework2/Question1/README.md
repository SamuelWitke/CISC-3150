## Question 1:  
Write a program that asks the user how tall of a pyramid do they want to   
display on the screen, and then displays the pyramid that counts up on the   
left, and counts down on the right. For eg, if the user enters 4, the   
program shows:  

        1  
      1 2 1  
    1 2 3 2 1  
  1 2 3 4 3 2 1  

# Output

      1 
    1 2 1 
  1 2 3 2 1 
1 2 3 4 3 2 1
</pre>

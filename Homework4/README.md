Write a program that finds and prints all the solutions to the N-Queens 
problem for a given N. At the end of your program, print how many 
solutions were found.

What is the N-Queens problem, you ask? 
1) Google it. 
2) It's the same as N-1 Queens problem. But with one more Queen.

Note: Backtracking is the easy way to do this. Try doing it with 
arrays/loops instead.

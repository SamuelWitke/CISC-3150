Question 1: Let's say that you draw a square around the top right 
quadrant of a circle. If the circle has a radius r, then the square that 
covers the top right quadrant of the circle will cover an area r^2.

The area of a circle is Pi*r^2. Given that we're dealing with only the top 
right quadrant, the area will be (Pi*r^2)/4. The ratio of the area of 
the top right quadrant of the circle to the square that covers it would 
be...?

Generate 4 billion random dots that fall within that square. Figure out 
how many of them fall inside the circle, and how many fall outside of it. 
If you divide the number of dots that fall within the circle by the total 
number of dots (the ones that fell anywhere in the entire square), you 
should get roughly the same ratio as the one you computed above. From 
there, you should be able to calculate the value of PI.

Btw, this is known as the monte carlo method, if you wanna google stuff.

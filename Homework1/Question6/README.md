## Question 6:   
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and   
radiuses of two circles. Determine whether the circles are separate from   
each other, touching each other, overlapping each other, or completely   
within one another. Test each case and show the output.  

## Output  
Enter 3 Points Separated Comma ex. x,y,radius 2,3,1  
1,1,1  
1,1,1  
The circles are  completely within each other  

Enter 3 Points Separated Comma ex. x,y,radius 2,3,1  
0,0,1  
0,2,1  
The circles are touching each other  

Enter 3 Points Separated Comma ex. x,y,radius 2,3,1  
0,0,1  
1,1,6  
The circles are overlapping each other  

Enter 3 Points Separated Comma ex. x,y,radius 2,3,1  
1,1,1  
5,6,1  
The circles are separate from each other

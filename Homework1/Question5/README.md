## Question 5:
Write a program that reads three 2D points A, B, and C from the user. 
Next, calculate the length of each side of the triangle using the 
distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2). Finally, determine if it's a 
real triangle. For a triangle to be real, the sum of any two sides needs 
to be greater than the third. Make sure your output has some real and at 
least one fake triangle.

## Output
Enter 3 2D Points Seperated By Comma ex. 2,3    
3,2  
1,4

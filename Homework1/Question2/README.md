## Question 2: 
In a loop, read radiuses from a user. Calculate the area of a circle using 
the formula PI*r^2. Use the pow function, and the PI constant in the Math 
class. Pick your data types wisely. Exit when the user sends EOF (either 
ctrl-d, or ctrl-z depending on your operating system). Show your output.

## Output
Enter Radius 
3
Given the radius 3, the area is 28.274334
